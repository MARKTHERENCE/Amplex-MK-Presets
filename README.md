Various amp schematics translated into .TXT files, written for the guitar amp sim plugin "[Amplex]( https://nalexsoft.blogspot.com/2021/11/amplex-multiamp.html )" developed by [NaLex Software]( https://nalexsoft.blogspot.com ).

## IMPORTANT!
Only the preamp circuits are ported. As such, the Power Amp knobs in Amplex's GUI will not work, so you must add a 3rd party power amp sim after. Below are the ones I would recommend:
- [Ignite Amps TPA-1]( https://www.igniteamps.com/#tpa-1 )
- [NaLex PowerBox]( https://nalexsoft.blogspot.com/2020/05/powerbox-poweramp.html )

## CAUTION!
There may be cases where some of the presets will not work correctly, it is largely in part of a bug within Amplex's oversampling feature.

A workaround for this is to set the oversampling to 8x only (if you have touched the oversampling settings prior), and restart the plugin.
